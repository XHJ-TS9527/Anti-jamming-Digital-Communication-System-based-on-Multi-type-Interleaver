# Anti-jamming-digital-communication-system-based-on-multi-type-interleaver
This is the engineer code of anti-jamming digital communication system based on multi type interleaver.
Console environment: Quartus II â‰¥ 9.1. ModelSim shall be the corresponding version to the Quartus.
MATLAB code is just for demonstration to the concept and meaning of interleaver, with no contribution to the construction of interleaver. Python code mainly translate some text into VHDL.
